# ðŸ‘‹ Rico's here, nice to meet you!

Most of my projects are private because I actively work on client projects.
Not actively update because experienced suspicious activity and hacking attempts on this account.

I am now sharing my projects for learning, personal growth, and portfolio purposes.

I use Golang, Node.js, React.js, Next.js
For database i use PostgreSQL and MongoDB
Tools i use Docker and Kubernetes

Right now actively learning blockchain for Web3 Development!
